<p class="pr1"><big><b>They had discovered a new planet&mdash;but its people
did not see them until after they had traveled on.</b></big></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Albrecht and</span> I went down
in a shuttleship, leaving the stellatomic
orbited pole-to-pole two
thousand miles above Alpha Centauri's
second planet. While we
took an atmosphere-brushing approach
which wouldn't burn off
the shuttle's skin, we went as
swiftly as we could.</p>

<p>A week before we had completed
man's first trip through
hyperspace. We were now making
the first landing on an inhabited
planet of another sun. All the
preliminary investigations had
been made via electronspectroscopes
and electrontelescopes from
the stellatomic.</p>

<p>We knew that the atmosphere
was breathable and were reasonably
certain that the peoples of
the world into whose atmosphere
we were dropping were at peace.
We went unarmed, just the two of
us; it might not be wise to go in
force.</p>

<p>We were silent, and I know
that Harry Albrecht was as perplexed
as I was over the fact that
our all-wave receivers failed to
pick up any signs of radio communication
whatever. We had assumed
that we would pick up
signals of some type as soon as
we had passed down through the
unfamiliar planet's ionosphere.</p>

<p>The scattered arrangement of
the towering cities appeared to
call for radio communications.
The hundreds of atmosphere ships
flashing along a system of airways
between the cities seemed
to indicate the existence of electronic
navigational and landing
aids. But perhaps the signals were
all tightly beamed; we would
know when we came lower.</p>

<p>We dropped down into the airway
levels, and still our receivers
failed to pick up a signal of any
sort&mdash;not even a whisper of static.
And strangely, our radarscopes
failed to record even a blip from
their atmosphere ships!</p>

<p>"I guess it's our equipment,
Harry," I said. "It just doesn't
seem to function in this atmosphere.
We'll have to put Edwards
to work on it when we go back
upstairs."</p>

<p>We spotted an airport on the
outskirts of a large city. The runways
were laid out with the precision
of Earth's finest. I put our
ship's nose eastward on a runway
and took it down fast through
a lull in the atmosphere ship
traffic.</p>

<p>As we went down I saw tiny
buildings spotted on the field
which surely housed electronic
equipment, but our receivers remained
silent.</p>

<p>I taxied the shuttle up to an
unloading ramp before the airport's
terminal building and I
killed the drive.</p>

<p>"Harry," I said, "if it weren't
that their ships are so outlandishly
stubby and their buildings so outflung,
we might well be on Earth!"</p>

<p>"I agree, Captain. Strange,
though, that they're not mobbing
us. They couldn't take this delta-winged
job for one of their ships!"</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> strange.</p>

<p>I looked up at the observation
ramp's occupants&mdash;people who
except for their bizarre dress
might well be of Earth&mdash;and saw
no curiosity in the eyes that
sometimes swept across our position.</p>

<p>"Be that as it may, Harry, we
certainly should cause a stir in
these pressure suits. Let's go!"</p>

<p>We walked up to a dour-looking
individual at a counter at the
ramp's end. Clearing my throat,
I said rather inanely, "Hello!"&mdash;but
what <i>does</i> one say to an extrasolarian?</p>

<p>I realized then that my voice
seemed thunderous, that the only
other sounds came from a
distance: the city's noise, the atmosphere
ships' engines on the
horizon&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p>The Centaurian ignored us.</p>

<p>I looked at the atmosphere
ships in the clear blue sky, at the
Centaurians on the ramp who
appeared to be conversing&mdash;and
there was no sound from those
planes, no sound from the people!</p>

<p>"It's impossible," Harry said.
"The atmosphere's nearly Earth-normal.
It should be&mdash;well, damn
it, it <i>is</i> as sound-conductive; <i>we're</i>
talking, aren't we?"</p>

<p>I looked up at the Centaurians
again. They were looking excitedly
westward. Some turned to
companions. Mouths opened and
closed to form words we could
not hear. Wide eyes lowered, following
something I could not see.
Sick inside, I turned to Albrecht
and read confirmation in his
drawn, blanched face.</p>

<p>"Captain," he said, "I suspected
that we might find something like
this when we first came out of
hyperspace and the big sleep. The
recorders showed we'd exceeded
light-speed in normal space-time
just after the transition. Einstein
theorized that time would not pass
as swiftly to those approaching
light-speed. We could safely exceed
that speed in hyperspace but
should never have done so in
normal space-time. Beyond light-speed
time must conversely accelerate!</p>

<p>"These people haven't seen <i>us</i>
yet. They certainly just observed
our landing. As we suspected,
they probably do have speech and
radio&mdash;but we can't pick up
either. We're seconds ahead of
them in time and we can't pick
up from the past sounds of nearby
origin or nearby signals radiated
at light-speed. They'll see and
hear us soon, but we'll never receive
an answer from <i>them</i>! Our
questions will come to them in
their future but we can never pick
answers from their past!"</p>

<p>"Let's go, Harry," I said
quickly.</p>

<p>"Where?" he asked. "Where
can we ever go that will be an improvement
over this?" He was
resigned.</p>

<p>"Back into space," I said.
"Back to circle this system at a
near-light-speed. The computers
should be able to determine how
long and how slow we'll have to
fly to cancel this out. If not, we
are truly and forever lost!"</p>
